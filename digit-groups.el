  "Make it easier to read large numbers by highlighting digits at selected place-value positions (e.g., thousands place, millions place, billions place, etc.).

For example, in the text `9876543210.123456789`, the default
configuration formats in bold the 3, 6, and 9 before the
decimal (`.`) because they are in the thousands, millions, and
billions positions as well as the 3, 6, and 9 after the
decimal (`.`) because they are in the thousandths, millionths,
and billionths positions.

To use this package, customize `digit-groups-mode-hooks` to be a
list of mode hooks for the modes in which you want highlighting
and make sure `font-lock-mode` is enabled for those modes.  For
example, to enable highlighting for all modes, either customize
`digit-groups-mode-hooks` to be `'(text-mode-hook prog-mode-hook
special-mode-hook)` or add the following clause to the
`custom-set-variables` in your `.emacs`.

    (custom-set-variables
      ...
      '(digit-groups-mode-hooks
        (quote (text-mode-hook prog-mode-hook special-mode-hook)))
      ...)

If you want highlighting for just the current buffer, first, make
sure `font-lock-mode` is enabled for the current buffer, then
call the `digit-groups-enable` function.

The default configuration highlights every third place-value
position between the novemdecillionths (10^-60) position and the
novemdecillions (10^60) position with the exception of the
units (10^0) position.  That is to say, it highlights the 10^i
place-value position when i is a multiple of 3 between -60 and
60 (inclusive) but is not 0.  This highlights the thousands,
millions, billions, etc. positions as well as the thousandths,
millionths, billionths, etc. positions.  This can be changed by
customizing `digit-groups-groups`.

Changes to the configuration take effect only when a mode hook in
`digit-groups-mode-hooks` is run.  Thus, you may need to reload
any affected buffers before you see the effect of any
configuration changes."
